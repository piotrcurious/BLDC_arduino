# BLDC_arduino
BLDC controller for Arduino 
created by bing AI.
Many errors in maximum power point, current limiting, inductance finding... to fix...

h-bridge driver - simple transoptor mosfet driver, 
like P701. 
Enable pin drives negative LED terminal, so logic should be inverted.
PWM drives positive LED terminals.
